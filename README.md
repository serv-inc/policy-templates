**IMPORTANT**: This file is in active development along with the policies in Firefox. To get the policy information that corresponds to a specific release, go to https://github.com/mozilla/policy-templates/releases.

Policies can either be specified using the Group Policy templates or by creating a file called `policies.json`. On Windows, create a directory called `distribution` where the EXE is located and place the file there. On Mac, the file goes into `Firefox.app/Contents/Resources/distribution`.  On Linux, the file goes into `firefox/distribution`, where `firefox` is the installation directory for firefox, which varies by distribution.

The content of the JSON file should look like this:
```
{
  "policies": {
    ...POLICIES...
  }
}
```
Policies are documented below.   


**Note**: though comments are used in this readme file for documentation, comments are not valid in actual JSON files. Remove all comments before attempting to deploy.

Some of the policies were originally only available on the ESR for security reasons. As of Firefox 62, these policies are available outside of the ESR, but only via JSON file or a Local Machine-based Group Policy. User-based Group Policies are not allowed to set values for these policies. The descriptions below mark such policies as "Machine only".
